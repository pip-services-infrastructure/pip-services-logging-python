## <a name="setup"></a> Environment Setup

This is a Python project and you have to install Python 2.7. 
You can download them from official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

After node is installed you can check it by running the following command:
```bash
python --version
```

To work with GitHub code repository you need to install Git from: https://git-scm.com/downloads

If you are planning to develop and test using persistent storages other than flat files
you may need to install database servers:
- Download and install MongoDB database from https://www.mongodb.org/downloads

## <a name="install"></a> Installing

After your environment is ready you can check out microservice source code from the Github repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:pip-services-infrastructure/pip-services-logging-python.git
```

Then go to the project folder and install dependent modules:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you worked with the microservice before you can check out latest changes and update the dependencies:
```bash
# Update source code updates from github
git pull

# Update dependencies
pip update
```

## <a name="test"></a> Testing

Before you execute tests you need to set configuration options in config.yaml file.
As a starting point you can use example from config.example.yaml:

```bash
copy config.example.yaml config.yaml
``` 

After that check all configuration options. Specifically, pay attention to connection options
for database and dependent microservices. For more information check [Configuration Guide](Configuration.md) 

Command to run unit tests:
```bash
py.test test -s
```

You can also execute benchmarks as:
```bash
???
```
